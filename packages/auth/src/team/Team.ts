  /**************** INVITATIONS

  Inviting a new member: 

    Alice generates an invitation using a secret seed. The seed an be randomly generated, or
    selected by Alice. Alice sends the invitation to Bob using a trusted channel.

    Meanwhile, Alice adds Bob to the signature chain as a new member, with appropriate roles (if
    any) and any corresponding lockboxes. 

    Bob can't authenticate directly as that member, since it has random temporary keys created by
    Alice. Instead, Bob generates a proof of invitation, and when they try to connect to Alice or
    Charlie they present that proof instead of authenticating.

    Once Alice or Charlie verifies Bob's proof, they send him the team chain. Bob uses that to
    instantiate the team, then he updates the team with his real public keys and adds his current
    device information. 

  Inviting an existing member's device: 

    On his laptop, Bob generates an invitation using a secret seed. He gets that seed to his phone
    using a QR code or by typing it in. 

    On his phone, Bob connects to his laptop (or to Alice or Charlie). Bob's phone presents its
    proof of invitation. 

    Once Bob's laptop or Alice or Charlie verifies Bob's phone's proof, they send it the team chain.
    Using the chain, the phone instantiates the team, then adds itself as a device.

    *Note:* A member can only invite their own devices. A non-admin member can only remove their own
    device; an admin member can remove a device for anyone.
